abstract="Computer simulations of granular materials are often based on the Distinct Element Method (DEM) where each grain is considered individually. Since large quantities of grains are required to perform realistic experiments, high performance computing is mandatory. This paper presents the basis of the DEM, a sequential algorithm for spherical grains in 3D and the adaptations to obtain a parallel version of that algorithm. Visualization is also discussed, as the drawing and animation of large sets of grains require special techniques and state-of-the-art graphics hardware. Finally, some applications are presented.",

abstract = {The distinct element method is a numerical model capable of describing the mechanical behavior of assemblies of discs and spheres. The method is based on the use of an explicit numerical scheme in which the interaction of the particles monitored contact by contact and the motion of the particles modelled particle by particle. The main features of the distinct element method are described. The method is validated by comparing force vector plots obtained from the computer program BALL with the corresponding plots obtained from a photoelastic analysis.},
